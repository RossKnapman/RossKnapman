# Ross Knapman

I am a postdoctoral researcher with the [TWIST group](https://www.uni-due.de/physik/twist/) at the University of Duisburg-Essen, studying topological magnetic textures such as skyrmions. I was previously a PhD student at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, and have a master's degree in physics from Durham University.

I am passionate about free and open-source software, open data, and scientific computing.
