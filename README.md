# Ross Knapman

I am a PhD student in theoretical condensed matter physics at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany. I work with the [TWIST](https://www.twist.uni-mainz.de/) and [INSPIRE](https://www.sinova-group.physik.uni-mainz.de/) groups, studying topological magnetic textures such as skyrmions.
